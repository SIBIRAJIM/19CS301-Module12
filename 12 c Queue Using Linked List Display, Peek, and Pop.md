# 12 c Queue Using Linked List â€“ Display, Peek, and Pop

## Aim

To write a Python program to insert 3 elements into a queue and display each element with its index.

## Algorithm

1. Start  
2. Create a queue  
3. Append elements to the queue  
4. Use a loop to print each element and its index  
5. Stop

## Program

```
# Reg.No-212223050048
# Name-SIBIRAJI M
# Write your code here
queue = []

# Enqueue elements into the queue
queue.append("a")
queue.append("b")
queue.append("c")

# Display the initial queue
print("Initial queue:", queue)

# Display index and element
for i in range(len(queue)):
    print(i, queue[i])
```

## OUTPUT

![{B12B682D-1CB7-4FE4-8634-48B8EDBF2064}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb7920d-72d1-4ee5-8770-2cfd1485cb08)

## RESULT
